      { "text":  "1.The bible and the law of hygiene Encyclopedia Britannica documents that in 1845, a young doctor in Vienna named Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was horrified at the terrible death rate of woman who gave birth in hospitals. As many as 30 percent died after childbirth. Semmelweis noted that doctors would examine the bodies of patients who died, then, without washing their hands, go straight to the next ward and examine expectant mothers. This was their normal practice because the presence of microscopic diseases was unknown. Semmelweis insisted that doctors wash their hands before each examination, and the death rate immediately dropped to 2 percent. Look at the specific instructions God gave thousands of years ago to His people for when they encountered disease: \"And when he who has a discharge is cleaned of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water; then he shall be clean\" (Leviticus 15:13). Until recent years, doctors washed their hands in a bowl of water, leaving invisible germs on their hands. However, the Bible says specifically to wash under \"running water.\"" },
      { "text":  "2. True Eyewitness Account of Jesus Matthew, a disciple of Jesus Christ, gave his eyewitness account of Jesus’ persecution before the cross, saying: \"Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, 'Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?'\" (Matthew 26:67-68). At first, this verse seems unclear—why would Jesus need to prophesy who struck Him if they were right in front of Him? However, Luke, another disciple of Jesus, provides additional detail in his account: \"They blindfolded him and demanded, 'Prophesy! Who hit you?'\" (Luke 22:64)  These verses, written by different authors, describe the same event with slight variations, which is evidence of independent eyewitness testimony rather than fabrication. If these accounts were part of a coordinated effort to invent a story, they would either be identical—similar to how criminals fabricate false testimonies—or contradictory. Instead, they align, confirming the historical accuracy of an eyewitness account of Jesus’ life. Additionally, this form of mockery aligns with known customs of ancient trials, further reinforcing the Bible’s truthfulness." },

Medical science has now discovered that this is the day that the coagulating factor in the blood, called prothrombin, is the highest. It reaches its peak on the eighth day, then drops. Medical science has also discovered that this is when the human body's immune system is at its peak." },

        "text": "4. Isaiah 40:22 (written 2800 years ago): \"It is he that sits upon the circle of the earth.\" The Bible informs us here that the earth is round. At a time when science believed that the earth was flat, it was the Scriptures that inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world. He wrote: \"It was the Lord who put it into my mind. I could feel His hand upon me… there is no question the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit because He comforted me with rays of marvelous illumination from the Holy Scriptures…\" (From his diary, in reference to his discovery of \"the New World\")."
