      "fact": "The Encyclopedia Britannica records that in 1845, a young Viennese doctor, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, was appalled by the high mortality rate of women giving birth in hospitals—often reaching 30%. He observed that doctors would perform autopsies and then, without washing their hands, proceed to examine pregnant women. At the time, the existence of microscopic diseases was unknown, and this unhygienic practice was routine. Semmelweis mandated that doctors wash their hands before each examination, reducing the death rate to just 2%. Remarkably, God had given specific hygiene instructions thousands of years earlier in Leviticus, including washing in running water—a practice later confirmed as essential for disease prevention.",

At first, it may seem unclear why they demanded He prophesy who struck Him when they were right in front of Him. However, Luke provides additional context, noting that Jesus was blindfolded during the mockery. These slightly different details indicate independent eyewitness testimony rather than fabrication. If the story were invented, the accounts would either be identical, like rehearsed lies, or contradictory. Instead, they align, reinforcing their authenticity. Additionally, this form of mockery matches known customs of ancient trials, further supporting the Bible’s historical accuracy.",

He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

Written over 3,500 years ago, this account comes straight from God’s own words to Job, detailing a massive, plant-eating beast with strength in its hips, a tail like a cedar tree, bones as strong as brass and iron, and a habitat among shady trees and rivers. It could drink vast amounts of water, even trusting it could \"draw up the Jordan\" into its mouth, and its nose could pierce snares. Despite its grandeur as the \"chief of the ways of God,\" the text hints that God, its Creator, allowed it to vanish from the earth. While some speculate it could be a dinosaur or an ancient megafauna, its extinction remains a mystery that science can’t fully unravel, yet the Bible boldly preserves its memory.",

Matthew Maury (1806–1873), considered the father of oceanography, made a significant breakthrough. While bedridden during a serious illness, he asked his son to read a portion of the Bible to him. Maury noticed the phrase \"paths of the sea.\" After recovering, he took God's word literally and set out to find these paths. His book on oceanography remains a foundational text on the subject and is still used in universities today.",

      "fact": "Job 28:25 reveals that the wind has 'a weight,' a fact stated in Scripture long before science confirmed in the sixteenth century that air possesses mass. The Bible also notes the weight of water, highlighting its significance. With vast amounts of water covering the earth, the gravitational pull of the sun and moon is perfectly balanced. The water absorbs and disperses this energy, its weight meticulously calibrated.\" —Richard Gunther  ",

      "fact": "For centuries, scientists held a geocentric view, believing the sun orbited a stationary earth to create day and night. Today, we understand that the earth’s rotation on its axis causes the sun to rise and set. Yet, over 4,000 years ago, as it says in Job, the earth is described as being turned like clay on a seal. This imagery evokes a clay vessel being spun on a potter’s wheel—a striking and accurate depiction of the earth’s rotation.   ",
