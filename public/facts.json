      "fact": "The Encyclopedia Britannica records that in 1845, a young Viennese doctor, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, was appalled by the high mortality rate of women giving birth in hospitals—often reaching 30%. He observed that doctors would perform autopsies and then, without washing their hands, proceed to examine pregnant women. At the time, the existence of microscopic diseases was unknown, and this unhygienic practice was routine. Semmelweis mandated that doctors wash their hands before each examination, reducing the death rate to just 2%. Remarkably, God had given specific hygiene instructions thousands of years earlier in Leviticus, including washing in running water—a practice later confirmed as essential for disease prevention.",

At first, it may seem unclear why they demanded He prophesy who struck Him when they were right in front of Him. However, Luke provides additional context, noting that Jesus was blindfolded during the mockery. These slightly different details indicate independent eyewitness testimony rather than fabrication. If the story were invented, the accounts would either be identical, like rehearsed lies, or contradictory. Instead, they align, reinforcing their authenticity. Additionally, this form of mockery matches known customs of ancient trials, further supporting the Bible’s historical accuracy.",

He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

Written over 3,500 years ago, this account comes straight from God’s own words to Job, detailing a massive, plant-eating beast with strength in its hips, a tail like a cedar tree, bones as strong as brass and iron, and a habitat among shady trees and rivers. It could drink vast amounts of water, even trusting it could \"draw up the Jordan\" into its mouth, and its nose could pierce snares. Despite its grandeur as the \"chief of the ways of God,\" the text hints that God, its Creator, allowed it to vanish from the earth. While some speculate it could be a dinosaur or an ancient megafauna, its extinction remains a mystery that science can’t fully unravel, yet the Bible boldly preserves its memory.",

Matthew Maury (1806–1873), considered the father of oceanography, made a significant breakthrough. While bedridden during a serious illness, he asked his son to read a portion of the Bible to him. Maury noticed the phrase \"paths of the sea.\" After recovering, he took God's word literally and set out to find these paths. His book on oceanography remains a foundational text on the subject and is still used in universities today.",

Scripture accurately foretold the rise and fall of mighty empires such as Greece and Rome (Daniel 2:39-40) and predicted the downfall of cities like Tyre and Sidon (Isaiah 23). Ancient historians document Tyre’s destruction, detailing how Alexander the Great besieged the city for seven months in 332 B.C. Earlier, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had failed to conquer the coastal stronghold after a 13-year siege ending in 573 B.C. During that time, many of Tyre’s residents relocated to a new island settlement half a mile offshore, protected by walls up to 150 feet high. Alexander’s eventual attack fulfilled the remaining prophecies (Zechariah 9:4; Ezekiel 26:12) about the island city: he demolished Tyre, killed 8,000 of its people, and sold 30,000 into slavery. To reach the island, he used the debris of the old mainland city—exactly as Scripture predicted—casting its dust and rubble into the sea to construct a 200-foot-wide causeway. The Bible also foresaw Alexander’s death and the killing of his two sons. Another remarkable prophecy was Jesus’ precise foretelling of Jerusalem’s destruction and the global dispersal of the Jewish people, recorded in Luke 21. In A.D. 70, Titus, the future Roman emperor, razed Jerusalem, fulfilling yet another of Jesus’ predictions (Matthew 24:1-2)—the total destruction of God’s temple.",

   sound the alarm on my holy hill.
Let all who live in the land tremble,
   for the day of the Lord is coming.
It is close at hand—
2 a day of darkness and gloom,
   a day of clouds and blackness.
Like dawn spreading across the mountains
   a large and mighty army comes,
such as never was in ancient times
   nor ever will be in ages to come.  
3 Before them fire devours,
   behind them a flame blazes.
Before them the land is like the garden of Eden,
   behind them, a desert waste—
   nothing escapes them.  
4 They have the appearance of horses;
   they gallop along like cavalry.
5 With a noise like that of chariots
   they leap over the mountaintops,
like a crackling fire consuming stubble,
   like a mighty army drawn up for battle.  
6 At the sight of them, nations are in anguish;
   every face turns pale.
7 They charge like warriors;
   they scale walls like soldiers.
They all march in line,
   not swerving from their course.
8 They do not jostle each other;
   each marches straight ahead.
They plunge through defenses
   without breaking ranks.  
9 They rush upon the city;
   they run along the wall.
They climb into the houses;
   like thieves they enter through the windows.  
10 Before them the earth shakes,
   the heavens tremble,
the sun and moon are darkened,
   and the stars no longer shine.",

      "fact": "Joel presents a vivid depiction of the Battle of Armageddon, the ultimate conflict of all time. Written roughly 2,800 years ago, this prophecy describes a scene that the prophet, limited by his era’s technology, likens to horse-drawn chariots—the most advanced warfare he knew. Yet, its details eerily align with modern combat: fire precedes them (v. 3); they scorch the ground in their wake (v. 3); they obliterate everything in their path (v. 3); they charge at speeds akin to a horse’s gallop, 30–40 mph (v. 4); their rumble echoes like a multitude of chariots or a blazing inferno (v. 5); they scale walls effortlessly (v. 7); their formation remains unbroken (v. 7); swords fail to halt them (v. 8); they invade homes (v. 9); and their advance shakes the earth itself (v. 10). This ancient vision strikingly mirrors the destructive power of contemporary warfare, such as flame-throwing tanks.",

The gospel will reach every corner of the earth. Earthquakes will strike diverse regions; celestial signs will appear in the sun, moon, and stars; and Christians will face persecution across all nations. Fear of the future will overwhelm people, whose hearts will falter. Society will grow selfish, materialistic, arrogant, and proud. Homosexuality will rise, alongside blasphemy, apathy, intemperance, brutality, rebellious youth, hatred toward the righteous, ungodliness, pleasure-seeking, and widespread hypocrisy. False Bible teachers will attract large followings, driven by greed and eager to discredit the Christian faith (see 2 Peter 2:1–3). Scoffers will dismiss these signs, denying events like Noah’s flood and claiming such conditions are nothing new, their rejection fueled by a craving for lust (2 Peter 3:1–7). Yet, the Bible warns they misjudge God, misunderstanding His timeline. They assume His silence signals ignorance of their sins, when in reality, He delays His judgment, offering time for repentance to escape hell’s condemnation. Jesus highlighted a key sign to watch: the Jewish reclamation of Jerusalem. This occurred in 1967, after 2,000 years, aligning all these signs into a climactic fulfillment. (Drawn from Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; 1 Timothy 4; and 2 Timothy 3.)",

Astronomers can precisely measure when one season ends and another begins based on this motion. Additionally, a month is defined by the Moon's revolution around the Earth in relation to the Sun. Given that this knowledge was scientifically unknown 3,500 years ago, how could Moses, the traditionally accepted author of Genesis, have accurately described these celestial roles unless his words were divinely inspired?",

Today, we understand that the universe contains billions of stars, making them truly uncountable. The Bible also mentions that each star is unique, a fact confirmed by modern astronomy. While stars may appear identical to the naked eye or even through a telescope, their distinct compositions and characteristics are revealed through spectral analysis.

At the time, scientists believed the sun was stationary. However, modern science has revealed that the sun is actually moving through space at an incredible speed of approximately 600,000 miles per hour. It follows a vast \"circuit\" through the heavens, just as the Bible describes. This circuit is so enormous that it takes roughly 200 million years to complete one full orbit.",

We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious Hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us! It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness."

No other ancient text is subjected to as much scrutiny and criticism as the Bible. Critics often search for minute flaws, claiming there is a long gap between the events described in the New Testament and their recording. They also assert there is a gap between the earliest copies of the New Testament and the original manuscripts. However, in reality, these supposed gaps and discrepancies exist only in the minds of the critics, with historical and archaeological evidence continually supporting the authenticity and reliability of the Bible.",

      "fact": "Aristotle’s Ode to Poetics was written between 384 and 322 B.C., with the earliest surviving copy dating to A.D. 1100, representing a gap of 1,400 years. Similarly, Plato’s Tetralogies, written between 427 and 347 B.C., has only seven existing manuscripts, with the earliest copy dating to A.D. 900—over 1,200 years later. In contrast, the New Testament presents a much smaller gap. Jesus was crucified around A.D. 30, and the New Testament was written between A.D. 48 and 95. The earliest manuscripts date from the last quarter of the first century, with the second oldest dating to A.D. 125, a mere 35 to 40 years after the original writings by the apostles. We have more than 5,300 Greek manuscripts from the early centuries, and including other versions in Syriac, Latin, Coptic, and Aramaic, there are a total of 24,633 manuscripts confirming the New Testament’s text. Therefore, there was no significant delay between the events of the New Testament and the writings themselves, and the gap between the original writings and the earliest copies is minimal. With such a vast body of manuscript evidence, it is irrefutable that the New Testament we have today is virtually identical to the one written nearly 2,000 years ago.

Corroborating Writings

Critics often claim that no ancient writings outside the New Testament reference Jesus, which is a baseless accusation. Several historical texts confirm His birth, ministry, death, and resurrection, including those by Flavius Josephus (A.D. 93), the Babylonian Talmud (A.D. 70–200), Pliny the Younger’s letter to Emperor Trajan (circa A.D. 100), the Annals of Tacitus (A.D. 115–117), Mara Bar Serapion (after A.D. 73), and Suetonius’ Life of Claudius and Life of Nero (A.D. 120).

The Canon of Scripture

Another false claim often made by critics is that the ecumenical councils of A.D. 336, 382, 397, and 419 either added or removed books from the Bible. In reality, these councils affirmed the Church’s belief that the books already included in the Bible were divinely inspired. These gatherings did not alter the Bible’s content. By that time, the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament had already been accepted, and the New Testament, as written, naturally developed alongside the early Church. Each document, considered authentic from the first century, was passed down to future generations of Christians. Therefore, the claim that Emperor Constantine removed books from the Bible is nothing more than an uneducated rumor.",

      "fact": "By William F. Albright

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) in 1949 at Qumran had a profound impact on confirming the reliability of the Scriptures. Hidden in clay jars in cliff-side caves by a religious community, these ancient texts provide strong evidence supporting the Old Testament’s authenticity. The scrolls, meticulously copied by the Essenes, include a complete book of Isaiah and thousands of fragments from every Old Testament book except Esther. Dating from the third century B.C. to the first century A.D., they offer an invaluable early glimpse into the biblical texts and their prophecies.

Dating the Manuscripts
Carbon-14 dating of the scrolls provided an age of approximately 1917 years, with a 200-year margin of error. Paleographic and orthographic analysis also placed some manuscripts before 100 B.C. Albright dated the complete Isaiah scroll to around 100 B.C., confidently asserting the authenticity of the manuscript.

Archaeological Evidence
Pottery found near the manuscripts was from the late Hellenistic period (c. 150–63 B.C.) and early Roman period (c. 63 B.C. to A.D. 100). Coins discovered at the site were minted between 135 B.C. and A.D. 135, further confirming the early dating of the texts. The fabrics and weaves of the scrolls also supported this timeline.

Significance of the Discovery
Before the DSS, the oldest known manuscript of the Old Testament was the Masoretic Text (A.D. 900), with others dating around A.D. 1000. These older texts raised questions about the reliability of the Old Testament. However, the Dead Sea Scrolls, dating over 1,000 years earlier, provide confidence in the text's accuracy. The remarkable similarity between the DSS and the Masoretic Text shows how well the scriptures have been preserved.

Conclusion
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls provides critical evidence for the following:

Confirmation of the Hebrew Text’s accuracy

Support for the Masoretic Text

Validation of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Text (the Septuagint).
The Dead Sea Scrolls offer further assurance for the accuracy of both the Masoretic and Greek texts, particularly in the areas where the New Testament quotes the Old Testament.",

      "fact": "Over time, the theory of evolution has undergone significant changes, often marked by controversy and correction. One of the most infamous cases of scientific misinterpretation was the Piltdown Man hoax.

In 1912, British lawyer and amateur geologist Charles Dawson claimed to have discovered fragments of a human skull and an apelike jaw in a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. The find was celebrated as the missing link in human evolution, estimated to be between 300,000 and one million years old. For decades, experts hailed Piltdown Man as the evolutionary discovery of the century.

However, in the early 1950s, suspicions arose regarding the authenticity of the fossils. By 1953, the truth was undeniable—Piltdown Man was a fraud. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the skull belonged to a 600-year-old woman, while the jaw came from a 500-year-old orangutan from the East Indies.

Piltdown Man was not the only case of misleading evidence in the history of evolutionary theory. Nebraska Man, once heralded as an early human ancestor, was later determined to be based on nothing more than a single tooth—one that actually belonged to an extinct pig. Java Man, discovered in the early 20th century, was constructed from only a few skeletal fragments: a piece of skull, a thigh bone fragment, and three molar teeth. Much of the depiction of Java Man was left to artistic interpretation rather than scientific evidence. Today, Java Man is recognized as fully human.

Similarly, Heidelberg Man was reconstructed from a jawbone, a section of the chin, and a few teeth. Despite its resemblance to modern human jaws, many evolutionists still claim Heidelberg Man to be 250,000 years old. This reliance on dating methods is questionable—Time Magazine (June 11, 1990) published an article highlighting how geological studies have shown carbon dating can be significantly inaccurate.

Neanderthal Man, another figure often cited in evolutionary discussions, was initially depicted as primitive and apelike. However, further analysis revealed that he was fully human. His stooped posture was not due to evolutionary traits but rather disease. Evidence now shows that Neanderthals spoke, created art, and engaged in religious practices.

Doubts about the certainty of evolutionary claims have even been expressed by leading scientists. Dr. Colin Patterson, senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, delivered a keynote address at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1981. In his speech, he reflected on a startling realization:

"One morning I woke up and . . . it struck me that I had been working on this stuff for twenty years and there was not one thing I knew about it. That’s quite a shock—to learn that one can be misled for so long . . . I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people: ‘Can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one thing, any one thing that is true?’ I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History, and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar at the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time. Eventually, one person said, ‘I do know one thing—it ought not to be taught in high school.’”

These cases and testimonies highlight the need for careful scrutiny of evolutionary claims. As scientific understanding progresses, past assumptions continue to be challenged, reminding us that theories should be built on verifiable evidence rather than speculation.",

      "fact": "There are at least six different radiometric dating methods, each yielding varying results depending on the assumed age of the sample. The method selected is often aligned with the expected age based on the assumption being tested. For instance, when dinosaur bones containing carbon are found, carbon dating is typically avoided because it would suggest an age of only a few thousand years. Instead, another dating method is used that aligns with the expected age based on the geologic column. Any radiometric data that doesn't match the presumed age from the geologic column is often discarded, as Dr. Kent Hovind explains. One example of inconsistencies in dating methods comes from a study in Science magazine (Vol. 224, 1984), where shells from living snails were carbon-dated to be 27,000 years old. This case illustrates the complexities and potential inaccuracies inherent in radiometric dating. Dr. Ronald R. West also points out that the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution. The theory is often used as the basis for interpreting the fossil record, leading to circular reasoning. When the theory is used to interpret the fossils, and then the fossil record is cited as evidence supporting the theory, it creates a logical fallacy.",

      "fact": "In his book Darwin's Black Box, biochemistry professor Michael J. Behe, an evolutionist, introduces the concept of 'irreducible complexity,' presenting a strong challenge to Darwinian evolution. Behe uses the example of a mousetrap, which is made up of five essential components. If any one of these parts is missing, the mousetrap fails to function completely. Charles Darwin himself recognized the potential for such a challenge, stating, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down" (The Origin of Species).

The human eye is another example of irreducible complexity. It is an incredibly intricate organ, with thousands of interdependent components that must work together for vision to be possible. If even one of these functions is missing, the eye cannot operate as it was designed to. This raises the question: how could the eye have evolved if all of its components were necessary from the start for it to serve any functional purpose?

Even Darwin himself expressed difficulty in explaining how such a complex organ could have evolved, admitting, "To suppose that the eye, with all its remarkable mechanisms for adjusting focus at varying distances, regulating light intake, and correcting spherical and chromatic aberrations, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree" (The Origin of Species). In fact, the human eye's focusing muscles move an estimated 100,000 times a day, and the retina contains approximately 137 million light-sensitive cells—making the idea of its gradual evolution seem even more improbable.",

If any of these clotting factors are absent or defective, the clotting process fails. Hemophilia, a serious genetic disorder, results from a defect in one of the clotting factor genes. Individuals with hemophilia lack a necessary clotting factor and may bleed excessively, even from minor cuts.

The blood clotting process involves twelve specific chemical reactions. If evolution is true, then for this twelve-step process to work, it would have had to function perfectly from the very first generation.

Just as a building proves the existence of a builder and a painting reveals the presence of a painter, creation itself testifies to the existence of a Creator. In Romans, it is stated that the invisible qualities of God are clearly seen through the things He has made.

Faith in God is not required to acknowledge His existence but to receive His rewards (Hebrews 11:6). Renowned figures like Isaac Newton, Louis Pasteur, and Stephen Hawking have all recognized the evidence of a Creator in nature and the universe, with Hawking even admitting that understanding the universe’s origins would reveal "the mind of God."",

      "fact": "The intricate design of the human brain offers a glimpse into the remarkable mind of God. Weighing about 3 pounds and composed of 85% water, the brain is one of the body’s most hydrated organs. Interestingly, there is no direct correlation between brain size and intelligence; some people with smaller brains are far more intelligent than those with larger brains. The brain itself doesn't experience pain due to the absence of pain receptors, and it floats within the skull, cushioned by fluid that serves as a shock absorber.

By age 15, the brain stops growing in size, and its surface is covered in folds. If stretched out, the brain’s surface would cover two average student desks. It contains around 10 billion neurons, which is more than the entire population of the Earth, and processes 86 million bits of information daily. In addition, 100 billion glial cells support these neurons, making up half the brain’s mass. Even after death, the brain continues to send electrical signals for up to 37 hours. As we age, the number of nerve cells decreases, and by the time we reach our 70s or 80s, we may only have 75% of the nerve cells we were born with. Nerve impulses travel at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour, and if all the nerves in our body were placed end to end, they would stretch nearly 45 miles. The connections between nerve cells—axons and dendrites—if laid out, would encircle the Earth many times, with the dendrites alone stretching an astounding 100,000 miles.

Now, consider the vastness of the universe: the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest major galaxy to us, is home to more than 300 billion stars. The nearest star to Earth is a staggering 13 quintillion miles away—about 2.2 million light-years. Beyond Andromeda, billions of other galaxies stretch throughout the universe.

The complexity of the human brain and the immense scale of the universe both reflect the extraordinary power of the Creator's mind. Together, they "declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1).",

  "text": "118. We can glimpse the incredible mind of God by examining His creation, starting with one small part—the human brain. The brain, weighing about 3 pounds, is one of the body’s most watery organs, with its outer tissue being 85% water. Surprisingly, there’s no direct correlation between brain size and intelligence; some highly intelligent people have smaller brains than those with less intellectual ability. The brain itself doesn’t feel pain because it lacks pain receptors, and it floats in fluid within the skull, which acts as a shock absorber. By age 15, the brain stops growing in size. Its surface is covered in folds, and if it were spread out, it would cover two average student desks. The brain contains 10 billion neurons, far outnumbering the Earth's population, and processes 86 million bits of information daily. Supporting these neurons are 100 billion glial cells, which make up half the brain's mass. Even after death, the brain continues to send electrical signals for up to 37 hours. As we age, the number of nerve cells decreases, and by age 70 or 80, people may have only 75% of the nerve cells they were born with. Nerve impulses travel at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour, and if all the nerves in the body were laid end to end, they would stretch nearly 45 miles. The connections between nerve cells—axons and dendrites—if placed end to end, would encircle the Earth many times, with the dendrites alone stretching about 100,000 miles.\n\nNow, consider the vastness of the heavens: the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest major galaxy, is home to more than 300 billion stars. The nearest star is an astonishing 13 quintillion miles (or 2.2 million light-years) away. Beyond Andromeda, billions of other galaxies stretch out into the universe.\n\nThe complexity of the human brain and the immense scale of the universe reflect the extraordinary power of the Creator’s mind, and together they \"declare the glory of God\" (Psalm 19:1)."

  "text": "119. Take a moment to consider the soil. It naturally produces weeds—no one plants them or waters them. They even grow through cracks in sidewalks. Weeds appear in abundance, choking our crops and ruining our lawns. When you pull them out, they return. They are a curse. Similarly, much of the earth is uninhabitable, with vast deserts in Africa and other regions, and much of Australia is barren land. The earth is frequently rocked by earthquakes, battered by hurricanes, torn apart by tornadoes, soaked by floods, and scorched by droughts. Dangerous creatures like sharks, tigers, lions, snakes, and mosquitoes harm humanity. People suffer from disease, pain, and death—many plagued by cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and other debilitating illnesses. There are children with leukemia and people born with physical or mental disabilities. These realities make it clear that something is seriously wrong with the world.\n\nDoes this mean God made a mistake when creating humanity? What kind of tyrant would allow such suffering? Many use suffering as a reason to reject God, but it actually points us toward Him. Suffering is part of the explanation given in the Bible. The Bible tells us that because of Adam’s sin, the earth was cursed. Weeds, disease, and suffering are all consequences of sin. The Scriptures reveal that we live in a fallen world. God originally created man perfect in a perfect world, free of suffering. But when sin entered, death and misery followed. Those who understand God’s Word eagerly anticipate a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell. In this future kingdom, there will be no more pain, suffering, disease, or death. As 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, \"No eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love Him.\"\n\nImagine if food grew like weeds, if deserts became fertile, and if nature worked with humanity instead of against it. Imagine a world without disease, pain, or death. This would be the ideal state, but it’s not our current reality. Our situation is like a child who eats too much chocolate and gets sores on his face. He sees his reflection and feels depressed, but instead of stopping, he continues eating more chocolate, unaware that the very thing giving him pleasure is causing his suffering. The world is full of pain, yet instead of seeking God's solution and asking for forgiveness, we often dive deeper into sin, finding temporary relief but intensifying our suffering in the process—both now and eternally."

  "text": "120. The Bible Explains Death\n\nThe Bible provides answers to questions that science cannot. It tells us why we die and how we can overcome the power of death. But before we explore what Scripture says, let me ask you a question: how many unsolved murder cases do you think occurred in the United States between 1990 and 2000? Take a guess: A) 2,410, B) 31, or C) 100,000? Most people might guess 31, or some might guess 2,410. But the correct answer is C—over 100,000 people were killed in various ways, and no one was held accountable. If you were a loved one of one of these victims, you would no doubt feel outraged by such injustice. This makes the idea of final justice on the Day of Judgment seem reasonable. C. S. Lewis put it well: “There is no doctrine I would more willingly remove from Christianity than the doctrine of hell, if it were up to me. But it has the full support of Scripture and, especially, our Lord’s own words; it has always been held by the Christian Church, and it aligns with reason.”\n\nWhen we see crimes like these, the idea of hell makes sense—God cannot, will not, and should not allow wrongdoers to go free. But the Bible warns that God will be thorough in His judgment. You may not be a murderer, but consider this checklist based on the Ten Commandments:\n\n- Have you ever lied, even once?\n- Have you ever stolen anything, no matter the value?\n- Have you ever looked at someone with lust, as Jesus said was the same as committing adultery in the heart?\n\nIf you’ve answered \"yes\" to even these three, you are a liar, thief, and adulterer at heart according to God's standard. And that’s just three commandments. God sees all, and on the Day of Judgment, nothing will be hidden. Will you be innocent or guilty when you face God? Deep down, your conscience knows you will be guilty. Without forgiveness, this would mean eternal separation from God.\n\nBut the good news is that God doesn’t want anyone to be lost. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son, Jesus, to take the punishment for our sins: “God demonstrated His love for us, in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Jesus took on all of humanity’s sins, was wounded for our wrongs, and then rose from the dead, conquering death. There is no other way to be saved except through Jesus. No religion, no prophet, no amount of good deeds can save you—only Jesus.\n\nSo, cry out to God for forgiveness, repent, and trust in Jesus Christ, just as you would trust a parachute to save your life. Through the cross, God offers the gift of eternal life. Is that not an incredible offer?\n\nThink about it: you are going to die, maybe in 20 years or maybe tonight. What are you waiting for? Don’t let petty issues or your love for sin lead you to hell. Confess and turn away from your sins right now. If you’re unsure how, you can pray something like this:\n\n“Dear God, please forgive my sins (name them). I repent of all I have done wrong. I thank you for Jesus, who took my punishment and rose again. I trust in Him as my Lord and Savior. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”\n\nNow, read the Bible daily and follow what it teaches. God will never let you down."
