      { "text":  "1.The bible and the law of hygiene Encyclopedia Britannica documents that in 1845, a young doctor in Vienna named Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was horrified at the terrible death rate of woman who gave birth in hospitals. As many as 30 percent died after childbirth. Semmelweis noted that doctors would examine the bodies of patients who died, then, without washing their hands, go straight to the next ward and examine expectant mothers. This was their normal practice because the presence of microscopic diseases was unknown. Semmelweis insisted that doctors wash their hands before each examination, and the death rate immediately dropped to 2 percent. Look at the specific instructions God gave thousands of years ago to His people for when they encountered disease: \"And when he who has a discharge is cleaned of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water; then he shall be clean\" (Leviticus 15:13). Until recent years, doctors washed their hands in a bowl of water, leaving invisible germs on their hands. However, the Bible says specifically to wash under \"running water.\"" },
      { "text":  "2. True Eyewitness Account of Jesus Matthew, a disciple of Jesus Christ, gave his eyewitness account of Jesus’ persecution before the cross, saying: \"Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, 'Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?'\" (Matthew 26:67-68). At first, this verse seems unclear—why would Jesus need to prophesy who struck Him if they were right in front of Him? However, Luke, another disciple of Jesus, provides additional detail in his account: \"They blindfolded him and demanded, 'Prophesy! Who hit you?'\" (Luke 22:64)  These verses, written by different authors, describe the same event with slight variations, which is evidence of independent eyewitness testimony rather than fabrication. If these accounts were part of a coordinated effort to invent a story, they would either be identical—similar to how criminals fabricate false testimonies—or contradictory. Instead, they align, confirming the historical accuracy of an eyewitness account of Jesus’ life. Additionally, this form of mockery aligns with known customs of ancient trials, further reinforcing the Bible’s truthfulness." },

Medical science has now discovered that this is the day that the coagulating factor in the blood, called prothrombin, is the highest. It reaches its peak on the eighth day, then drops. Medical science has also discovered that this is when the human body's immune system is at its peak." },

At a time when science believed that the earth was flat, it was the Scriptures that inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world. He wrote: \"It was the Lord who put it into my mind. I could feel His hand upon me… there is no question the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit because He comforted me with rays of marvelous illumination from the Holy Scriptures…\" (From his diary, in reference to his discovery of \"the New World\")." },

God Himself is speaking): 10 Scientific Facts in the Bible Scientific 4/3/01 10:47 AM Page 10 \"Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eats grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moves his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lies under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. Behold, he drinks up a river, and hastens not: he trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. He takes it with his eyes: his nose pierces through snares\" (Job 40:15-24). This was the Largest of all creatures He made. It was plant-eating (herbivorous). It had its strength in its hips. Its tail was like a large tree (a cedar). It had very strong bones. Its habitat was among the trees. Drank massive amounts of water. His nose pierced through snares. Then Scripture says, \"…He that made him can make his sword approach to him.” In other words, God caused this, the largest of all the creatures He had made, to become extinct\""

        "text": "8.  Psalm 8:8: \"And the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas.\" What does the Bible mean by “paths” of the seas? The sea is just a huge mass of water, how then could it have “paths?” Man discovered the existence of ocean currents in the 1850’s, but the Bible declared the science of oceanography 2,800 years ago. Matthew Maury (1806- 1873) is considered to be the father of oceanography. He was bedridden during a serious illness and asked his son to read a portion of the Bible to him. While listening, he noticed the expression “paths of the sea.” Upon his recovery, Maury took God at His word and went looking for these paths. His book on oceanography is still considered a basic text on the subject and is still used in universities."

Where does all that water go? That’s just one of thousands of rivers.
