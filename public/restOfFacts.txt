Quarantine laws were not introduced by modern society until the seventeenth century. During the devastating Black Death of the fourteenth century, sick or dead individuals were often kept in the same rooms as the rest of the family. People wondered why the disease spread so quickly and attributed the epidemics to \"bad air\" or \"evil spirits.\" However, if the medical commands given in Leviticus had been followed, countless lives could have been saved. Arturo Castiglione noted the significance of this biblical medical law, writing, \"The laws against leprosy in Leviticus 13 may be regarded as the first model of sanitary legislation\" (A History of Medicine).— Grant R.

Remarkably, the Book of Leviticus, penned around 1400 B.C., proclaimed blood as the essence of life: \"For the life of the flesh is in the blood\" (17:11). Blood delivers water and nutrients to every cell, regulates body temperature, clears cellular waste, and transports oxygen from the lungs to every tissue. In 1616, William Harvey’s discovery of blood circulation as the cornerstone of physical vitality echoed a truth the Bible had unveiled 3,000 years prior.",

Scripture accurately foretold the rise and fall of mighty empires such as Greece and Rome (Daniel 2:39-40) and predicted the downfall of cities like Tyre and Sidon (Isaiah 23). Ancient historians document Tyre’s destruction, detailing how Alexander the Great besieged the city for seven months in 332 B.C. Earlier, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had failed to conquer the coastal stronghold after a 13-year siege ending in 573 B.C. During that time, many of Tyre’s residents relocated to a new island settlement half a mile offshore, protected by walls up to 150 feet high. Alexander’s eventual attack fulfilled the remaining prophecies (Zechariah 9:4; Ezekiel 26:12) about the island city: he demolished Tyre, killed 8,000 of its people, and sold 30,000 into slavery. To reach the island, he used the debris of the old mainland city—exactly as Scripture predicted—casting its dust and rubble into the sea to construct a 200-foot-wide causeway. The Bible also foresaw Alexander’s death and the killing of his two sons. Another remarkable prophecy was Jesus’ precise foretelling of Jerusalem’s destruction and the global dispersal of the Jewish people, recorded in Luke 21. In A.D. 70, Titus, the future Roman emperor, razed Jerusalem, fulfilling yet another of Jesus’ predictions (Matthew 24:1-2)—the total destruction of God’s temple.",

Verses 12–15 describe what will happen after what many see as the Battle of Armageddon: \"And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land...And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search. And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.\" Before the days of nuclear warfare, this portion of the Bible would have made no sense to the reader. We are told that even the weapons left by the enemy will have to be burned (Ezekiel 39:9). So many will die 44 that it will take those specially employed for the purpose seven months to bury the dead (v. 14). The Scriptures are very specific about the method of burial. When even a bone is found by searchers, a special marker is to be placed near the bone until the buriers have buried it. This would seem to be a clear reference to radioactive contamination after nuclear war. This thought is confirmed in Joel 2:30, which speaks of \"pillars of smoke.\""

Critics looking for the flyspeck in the masterpiece allege that there was a long span between the time the events in the New Testament occurred and when they were recorded.

  "text": "93. Manuscript Evidence. Aristotle’s Ode to Poetics was written between 384 and 322 B.C. The earliest copy of this work dates A.D. 1100, and there are only forty-nine extant manuscripts. The gap between the original writing and the earliest copy is 1,400 years. There are only seven extant manuscripts of Plato’s Tetralogies, written 427–347 B.C. The earliest copy is A.D. 900—a gap of over 1,200 years. What about the New Testament? Jesus was crucified in A.D. 30. The New Testament was written between A.D. 48 and 95. The oldest manuscripts date to the last quarter of the first century, and the second oldest A.D. 125. This gives us a narrow gap of thirty-five to forty years from the originals written by the apostles. From the early centuries, we have some 5,300 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Altogether, including Syriac, Latin, Coptic, and Aramaic, we have a whopping 24,633 texts of the ancient New Testament to confirm the wording of the Scriptures. So the bottom line is, there was no great period between the events of the New Testament and the New Testament writings. Nor is there a great time lapse between the original writings and the oldest copies. With the great body of manuscript evidence, it can be proved, beyond a doubt, that the New Testament says exactly the same things today as it originally did nearly 2,000 years ago. Corroborating Writings. Critics also charge that there are no ancient writings about Jesus outside the New Testament. This is another ridiculous claim. Writings confirming His birth, ministry, death, and resurrection include Flavius Josephus (A.D. 93), the Babylonian Talmud (A.D. 70–200), Pliny the Younger’s letter to the Emperor Trajan (approx. A.D. 100), the Annals of Tacitus (A.D. 115–117), Mara Bar Serapion (sometime after A.D. 73), and Suetonius’ Life of Claudius and Life of Nero (A.D. 120). Another point of contention arises when Bible critics have knowingly or unknowingly misled people by implying that Old and New Testament books were either excluded from or added into the canon of Scripture at the great ecumenical councils of A.D. 336, 382, 397, and 419. In fact, one result of these gatherings was to confirm the Church’s belief that the books already in the Bible were divinely inspired. Therefore, the Church, at these meetings, neither added to nor took away from the books of the Bible. At that time, the thirty-nine Old Testament books had already been accepted, and the New Testament, as it was written, simply grew up with the ancient Church. Each document, being accepted as it was penned in the first century, was then passed on to Christians of the next century. So, this foolishness about the Roman Emperor Constantine dropping books from the Bible is simply uneducated rumor."

  "text": "95. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bear Out the Bible By William F. Albright The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) at Qumran in 1949 had significant effects in corroborating evidence for the Scriptures. The ancient texts, found hidden in pots in cliff-top caves by a monastic religious community, confirm the reliability of the Old Testament text. These texts, which were copied and studied by the Essenes, include one complete Old Testament book (Isaiah) and thousands of fragments, representing every Old Testament book except Esther. The manuscripts date from the third century B.C. to the first century A.D. and give the earliest window found so far into the texts of the Old Testament books and their predictive prophecies. The Qumran texts have become an important witness for the divine origin of the Bible, providing further evidence against the criticism of such crucial books as Daniel and Isaiah. Dating the Manuscripts. Carbon-14 dating is a reliable form of scientific dating when applied to uncontaminated material several thousand years old. Results indicated an age of 1917 years with a 200-year (10 percent) variant. Paleography (ancient writing forms) and orthography (spelling) indicated that some manuscripts were inscribed before 100 B.C. Albright set the date of the complete Isaiah scroll to around 100 B.C.—“there can happily not be the slightest doubt in the world about the genuineness of the manuscript.” Archaeological Dating. Collaborative evidence for an early date came from archaeology. Pottery accompanying the manuscripts was late Hellenistic (c. 150–63 B.C.) and Early Roman (c. 63 B.C. to A.D. 100). Coins found in the monastery ruins proved by their inscriptions to have been minted between 135 B.C. and A.D. 135. The weave and pattern of the cloth supported an early date. There is no reasonable doubt that the Qumran manuscripts came from the century before Christ and the first century A.D. Significance of the Dating. Previous to the DSS, the earliest known manuscript of the Old Testament was the Masoretic Text (A.D. 900) and two others (dating about A.D. 1000) from which, for example, the King James version of the Old Testament derived its translation. Perhaps most would have considered the Masoretic text as a very late text and therefore questioned the reliability of the Old Testament wholesale. The Dead Sea Scrolls eclipse these texts by 1,000 years and provide little reason to question their reliability, and further, present only confidence for the text. The beauty of the Dead Sea Scrolls lies in the close match they have with the Masoretic text—demonstrable evidence of reliability and preservation of the authentic text through the centuries. So the discovery of the DSS provides evidence for the following: 1) Confirmation of the Hebrew Text 2) Support for the Masoretic Text 3) Support for the Greek translation of the Hebrew Text (the Septuagint). Since the New Testament often quotes from the Greek Old Testament, the DSS furnish the reader with further confidence for the Masoretic texts in this area where it can be tested."

According to the Bible, each living creature reproduces “after its own kind” (Genesis 1:24), whereas evolution suggests that species gradually evolve into entirely new forms. While microevolution (small changes within a species) is observable, there is no scientific evidence for macroevolution—the transformation of one species into another. The idea that humans evolved from primates relies on macroevolution, commonly referred to as “the theory of evolution.” Despite being widely taught, evolution raises more questions than answers. Consider: If the first bird evolved, did it breathe before lungs developed? If it survived without lungs, why evolve them at all? How did it eat before evolving a mouth? If evolution were truly scientific, why does it remain full of unproven assumptions? Numerous scientists, including those once committed to evolution, have criticized the theory’s inconsistencies. Professor Louis Bounoure, Director of Research at France’s National Center for Scientific Research, stated: “Evolution is a fairy tale for grown-ups. It has contributed nothing to scientific progress and is entirely useless.” (Sources: Michael Ruse, Darwin’s Theory: An Exercise in Science; Dr. T.N.

      {
  "text": "107. The Evolution of the Theory\n\nOver time, the theory of evolution has undergone significant changes, often marked by controversy and correction. One of the most infamous cases of scientific misinterpretation was the Piltdown Man hoax.\n\nIn 1912, British lawyer and amateur geologist Charles Dawson claimed to have discovered fragments of a human skull and an apelike jaw in a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. The find was celebrated as the missing link in human evolution, estimated to be between 300,000 and one million years old. For decades, experts hailed Piltdown Man as the evolutionary discovery of the century.\n\nHowever, in the early 1950s, suspicions arose regarding the authenticity of the fossils. By 1953, the truth was undeniable—Piltdown Man was a fraud. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the skull belonged to a 600-year-old woman, while the jaw came from a 500-year-old orangutan from the East Indies.\n\nPiltdown Man was not the only case of misleading evidence in the history of evolutionary theory. Nebraska Man, once heralded as an early human ancestor, was later determined to be based on nothing more than a single tooth—one that actually belonged to an extinct pig. Java Man, discovered in the early 20th century, was constructed from only a few skeletal fragments: a piece of skull, a thigh bone fragment, and three molar teeth. Much of the depiction of Java Man was left to artistic interpretation rather than scientific evidence. Today, Java Man is recognized as fully human.\n\nSimilarly, Heidelberg Man was reconstructed from a jawbone, a section of the chin, and a few teeth. Despite its resemblance to modern human jaws, many evolutionists still claim Heidelberg Man to be 250,000 years old. This reliance on dating methods is questionable—Time Magazine (June 11, 1990) published an article highlighting how geological studies have shown carbon dating can be significantly inaccurate.\n\nNeanderthal Man, another figure often cited in evolutionary discussions, was initially depicted as primitive and apelike. However, further analysis revealed that he was fully human. His stooped posture was not due to evolutionary traits but rather disease. Evidence now shows that Neanderthals spoke, created art, and engaged in religious practices.\n\nDoubts about the certainty of evolutionary claims have even been expressed by leading scientists. Dr. Colin Patterson, senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, delivered a keynote address at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1981. In his speech, he reflected on a startling realization:\n\n\"One morning I woke up and . . . it struck me that I had been working on this stuff for twenty years and there was not one thing I knew about it. That’s quite a shock—to learn that one can be misled for so long . . . I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people: ‘Can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one thing, any one thing that is true?’ I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History, and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar at the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time. Eventually, one person said, ‘I do know one thing—it ought not to be taught in high school.’”\n\nThese cases and testimonies highlight the need for careful scrutiny of evolutionary claims. As scientific understanding progresses, past assumptions continue to be challenged, reminding us that theories should be built on verifiable evidence rather than speculation."

      "text": "108. If there is no solid evidence for evolution, why is the theory so aggressively promoted? Sir Arthur Keith, who wrote the Foreword to the 100th edition of *The Origin of Species*, admitted, *“Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable.”*\n\nSimilarly, H.S. Lipson, professor of physics at the University of Manchester, UK, observed, *“In fact, evolution became in a sense a scientific religion; almost all scientists have accepted it, and many are prepared to ‘bend’ their observations to fit in with it.”* His statement highlights an undeniable truth—evolution functions as a belief system rather than a purely scientific framework.\n\nConsider how people become “believers” in evolution. An individual hears about evolution, accepts it without question, and adopts it as truth. Unlike religious conversion, which involves repentance and faith, belief in evolution requires only one thing—rejecting biblical creation. Some may criticize Mormons for their belief in Joseph Smith’s missing golden tablets, yet evolutionists place their faith in something just as elusive: the so-called *missing link*. Though no one has ever found this crucial piece of evidence, evolutionists remain convinced that it must exist somewhere.\n\nRejecting the biblical account of creation as presented in Genesis has led to what could be called *“Genecide”*—the eradication of humanity’s divine purpose and the loss of certainty about our origins. As a result, speculative theories about human beginnings have emerged from minds disconnected from God. These conjectures, often shaped by human imagination rather than truth, have misled generations into intellectual and spiritual aimlessness.\n\nWithout the foundation of Genesis, people drift across an ocean of uncertainty, speaking in speculative terms that offer no real hope or meaning. In contrast, Scripture provides certainty, truth, and purpose. Where the turbulent sea of human speculation breeds doubt and confusion, the light of Genesis shines as a beacon of clarity, guiding us toward the reality of our Creator and the purpose He has given us."

According to the Journal of Science, researchers claimed to have found evidence that life appeared on Earth 2.7 billion years ago—one billion years earlier than previously thought. Scientists, who were once certain of their original estimate, admitted they were off by an astounding 1,000,000,000 years. Yet, with this new finding, they were confident they had finally uncovered the truth—at least until the next discovery proved them wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in October 1999, CBS News reported the discovery of unknown animal bones in Asia, estimated to be as much as 40 million years old. This finding challenged the long-held belief that primates first evolved in Africa. Now, some scientists suggested that human ancestors may have originated in Asia instead. But, as history has shown, this belief would likely shift again with the next revelation.\n\nOn March 21, 2001, USA Today published an article stating, “Paleontologists have discovered a new skeleton in the closet of human ancestry that is likely to force science to revise, if not scrap, current theories of human origins.” Reuters followed up, reporting that the discovery had left evolutionary scientists “confused.” The article went on to state that “Lucy may not even be a direct human ancestor after all.”\n\nOver a century ago, Charles Spurgeon observed this pattern of uncertainty and shifting theories:\n\n“We are invited, brethren, most earnestly to go away from the old-fashioned belief of our forefathers because of the supposed discoveries of science. What is science? The method by which man tries to hide his ignorance. It should not be so, but so it is.\n\nYou are not to be dogmatical in theology, my brethren, it is wicked; but for scientific men, it is the correct thing. You are never to assert anything very strongly; but scientists may boldly assert what they cannot prove, and may demand a faith far more credulous than any we possess.\n\nForsooth, you and I are to take our Bibles and shape and mold our belief according to the ever-shifting teachings of so-called scientific men. What folly is this! The march of science, falsely so called, through the world may be traced by exploded fallacies and abandoned theories. Former explorers once adored are now ridiculed; the continual wrecking of false hypotheses is a matter of universal notoriety.\n\nYou may tell where the supposed learned have encamped by the debris left behind of suppositions and theories as plentiful as broken bottles.”\n\nWhile scientific theories constantly change, the Bible remains steadfast, offering an unshakable foundation of truth in the midst of ever-shifting human speculation."

Explosions cause chaos, not complexity. How, then, could a 'Big Bang' result in the intricate design seen in nature—a rose, an apple tree, a hummingbird, the changing seasons, or the vast diversity of animals, each with distinct features such as eyes, noses, and mouths?\n\nImagine conducting an experiment: completely empty your garage of every piece of metal, wood, paint, rubber, and plastic. Ensure that absolutely nothing remains. Then, wait for ten years and check if a fully assembled Mercedes-Benz has appeared. If it hasn’t, extend the experiment to 20 years. If still nothing, try 100 years. Then stretch it to 10,000 years. Even with infinite patience, the idea remains absurd.\n\nYet, evolutionists propose a solution—just add more time. If you wait for 250 million years, suddenly, the impossible becomes 'scientifically' plausible."

The excitement over the Archaeoraptor Liaoningensis fossil—discovered in northeastern China and shown at a gem and mineral show in Tucson, Arizona—captivated many. With a birdlike body and a meat-eater’s tail, it seemed to offer a potential link between dinosaurs and birds. Displayed at the National Geographic Society in Washington D.C., the exhibit drew around 110,000 visitors and received widespread media attention, including coverage in November’s National Geographic. But paleontologists now acknowledge the error: what was believed to be a crucial 'missing link' is actually a composite, likely altered by a Chinese farmer rather than offering proof of evolution.\n\nThis isn’t the first time a so-called 'missing link' has been exposed as a fraud. Back in 1912, the Piltdown Man fossil was hailed as a vital discovery linking humans and apes. Decades later, it was revealed as a hoax.\n\nAs Grant R. Jeffery points out in *The Signature of God*, Charles Darwin himself acknowledged that the discovery of millions of 'missing links' was necessary to validate his theory of evolution through gradual mutation. Despite extensive global fossil searches, not a single genuine missing link has been found to substantiate the theory.\n\nDavid Berlinski, a critic of Darwin’s theory, emphasizes the glaring gaps in the fossil record—places where there should be intermediate life forms but nothing exists. 'No paleontologist denies this,' he states. This is a well-established fact: Darwin’s theory and the fossil record are in direct conflict.\n\nAs Time magazine noted in 1977, scientists admit that their most beloved evolutionary theories are based on only a few fossil fragments, with vast gaps in the fossil record.\n\nG.K. Chesterton aptly captured the situation, saying, 'The evolutionists seem to know everything about the missing link except the fact that it is missing.'"

      "text": "112.There are at least six distinct radiometric dating methods available, each producing varying results depending on the presumed age of the sample. The method chosen typically corresponds with the expected age derived from the assumption under investigation. For example, when dinosaur bones containing carbon are discovered, carbon dating is not utilized because it would suggest an age of only a few thousand years. Since this result contradicts the presumed age based on the geologic column, another dating method is employed that yields a result more in line with the expected outcome. Any radiometric data that do not conform to the predetermined ages of the geologic column are discarded, as stated by Dr. Kent Hovind.\n\nAn example of dating inconsistency can be found in a study where shells from living snails were carbon-dated to an age of 27,000 years, as reported in *Science* magazine (Vol. 224, 1984). This case highlights the complexities and potential inaccuracies of radiometric dating techniques.\n\nRonald R. West, Ph.D., observes that the fossil record does not substantiate the Darwinian theory of evolution. The theory itself is often used as a framework for interpreting the fossil record, which can lead to circular reasoning. If we use the theory to interpret the fossil evidence, and then argue that the fossil record supports the theory, we are engaging in a logical fallacy."

Behe, who is an evolutionist, presents a significant challenge to Darwinian evolution through the concept of 'irreducible complexity.' He provides a straightforward example using a mousetrap, which consists of five key components that are essential for its function. If any one of these components is missing, the mousetrap fails to operate, rendering it entirely ineffective. Charles Darwin himself acknowledged the possibility of such a challenge, stating, 'If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down' (The *Origin of Species*).\n\nThe human eye presents another example of irreducible complexity. The eye is a highly intricate structure, with thousands of interdependent functions that work together to make it operational. If even one of these functions is absent, the eye ceases to function as an eye. This raises the question: how could the eye have evolved if all of its functions were necessary for it to have any practical value?\n\nCharles Darwin himself admitted the difficulty in explaining the evolution of such a complex organ, stating, 'To suppose that the eye, with all its remarkable mechanisms for adjusting focus at varying distances, regulating light intake, and correcting spherical and chromatic aberrations, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree' (*The Origin of Species*). Indeed, the eye’s focusing muscles move an estimated 100,000 times per day, and the retina contains around 137 million light-sensitive cells."

      "text": "114. The theory of evolution, which suggests that humans have existed for over a million years, faces a significant challenge. If we assume an average human generation lasts 43 years, then over a million years, there would have been around 23,256 generations. Starting with a single couple a million years ago, using the same assumption of 43 years per generation and an average of 2.5 children per family, the population growth should have led to an astronomical number of people. Specifically, this model would predict a population numbering in the trillions, followed by even more trillions—far exceeding the total number of atoms in the entire universe. Given such a vast population, one would expect to find enormous deposits of human remains—mountains of bones from the countless generations that lived and died. Yet, despite extensive archaeological and scientific research over the last two centuries, no evidence of such immense quantities of human remains has been discovered. The absence of these remains calls into question the evolutionary model of human history."

      "text": "115. Blood platelets play a crucial role in preventing excessive blood loss by initiating a series of reactions that lead to clotting. When blood begins to flow from a wound, platelets quickly respond, helping to form a clot and stop the bleeding. They begin by clumping together to create a plug at the wound site and then release proteins known as \"clotting factors.\" These proteins trigger a series of complex chemical reactions, each of which must occur correctly for the clot to form. If any of the clotting factors are missing or defective, the clotting process fails. Hemophilia, a serious genetic disorder, occurs when one of these clotting factor genes is defective. People with hemophilia lack one of the necessary clotting factors and may bleed excessively, even from minor cuts or scrapes.\n\nThe blood clotting process involves twelve specific chemical reactions. If evolution is true, then for this twelve-step process to work, it had to function perfectly from the very first generation. If any one of these reactions had failed or been out of order, no creatures would have survived—they would have bled to death."

      "text": "116. The creation account in Genesis and the theory of evolution are fundamentally incompatible—one must be true, and the other false. The fossil record supports the Genesis account. In the oldest rocks, we do not find a gradual progression of fossils showing the evolutionary transition from simple organisms to more complex forms. Instead, we observe fully developed species appearing abruptly. There are no intermediate fossils between species, which challenges the evolutionary narrative.\n\nProfessor H. S. Lipson, based on the evidence, concludes, \"We must... admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation. I know this is controversial for physicists, as it is for me, but we cannot dismiss a theory simply because we dislike it if the experimental evidence supports it.\""

  "text": "117. The dictionary defines a \"fact\" as something that exists or has occurred, while \"evolution\" is described as a theory—a belief rather than a proven fact. \"Creation,\" on the other hand, is defined as God's act of bringing the universe into existence, making it a fact. Evolution is an unproven theory, while creation is the undeniable evidence of a Creator.\n\nJust as a building proves the existence of a builder and a painting proves the existence of a painter, creation itself proves the existence of a Creator. Romans 1:20 says, \"For the invisible things of Him... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.\"\n\nFaith in God is required not to acknowledge His existence, but to receive His rewards (Hebrews 11:6). Notable figures like Isaac Newton, Louis Pasteur, and Stephen Hawking have acknowledged the evidence of a Creator in nature and the universe, with Hawking even admitting that understanding the universe’s origins would reveal \"the mind of God.\""

The brain, weighing about 3 pounds, is one of the body’s most watery organs, with its outer tissue being 85% water. Surprisingly, there’s no direct correlation between brain size and intelligence; some highly intelligent people have smaller brains than those with less intellectual ability. The brain itself doesn’t feel pain because it lacks pain receptors, and it floats in fluid within the skull, which acts as a shock absorber. By age 15, the brain stops growing in size. Its surface is covered in folds, and if it were spread out, it would cover two average student desks. The brain contains 10 billion neurons, far outnumbering the Earth's population, and processes 86 million bits of information daily. Supporting these neurons are 100 billion glial cells, which make up half the brain's mass. Even after death, the brain continues to send electrical signals for up to 37 hours. As we age, the number of nerve cells decreases, and by age 70 or 80, people may have only 75% of the nerve cells they were born with. Nerve impulses travel at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour, and if all the nerves in the body were laid end to end, they would stretch nearly 45 miles. The connections between nerve cells—axons and dendrites—if placed end to end, would encircle the Earth many times, with the dendrites alone stretching about 100,000 miles.\n\nNow, consider the vastness of the heavens: the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest major galaxy, is home to more than 300 billion stars. The nearest star is an astonishing 13 quintillion miles (or 2.2 million light-years) away. Beyond Andromeda, billions of other galaxies stretch out into the universe.\n\nThe complexity of the human brain and the immense scale of the universe reflect the extraordinary power of the Creator’s mind, and together they \"declare the glory of God\" (Psalm 19:1)."

  "text": "119. Take a moment to consider the soil. It naturally produces weeds—no one plants them or waters them. They even grow through cracks in sidewalks. Weeds appear in abundance, choking our crops and ruining our lawns. When you pull them out, they return. They are a curse. Similarly, much of the earth is uninhabitable, with vast deserts in Africa and other regions, and much of Australia is barren land. The earth is frequently rocked by earthquakes, battered by hurricanes, torn apart by tornadoes, soaked by floods, and scorched by droughts. Dangerous creatures like sharks, tigers, lions, snakes, and mosquitoes harm humanity. People suffer from disease, pain, and death—many plagued by cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and other debilitating illnesses. There are children with leukemia and people born with physical or mental disabilities. These realities make it clear that something is seriously wrong with the world.\n\nDoes this mean God made a mistake when creating humanity? What kind of tyrant would allow such suffering? Many use suffering as a reason to reject God, but it actually points us toward Him. Suffering is part of the explanation given in the Bible. The Bible tells us that because of Adam’s sin, the earth was cursed. Weeds, disease, and suffering are all consequences of sin. The Scriptures reveal that we live in a fallen world. God originally created man perfect in a perfect world, free of suffering. But when sin entered, death and misery followed. Those who understand God’s Word eagerly anticipate a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell. In this future kingdom, there will be no more pain, suffering, disease, or death. As 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, \"No eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love Him.\"\n\nImagine if food grew like weeds, if deserts became fertile, and if nature worked with humanity instead of against it. Imagine a world without disease, pain, or death. This would be the ideal state, but it’s not our current reality. Our situation is like a child who eats too much chocolate and gets sores on his face. He sees his reflection and feels depressed, but instead of stopping, he continues eating more chocolate, unaware that the very thing giving him pleasure is causing his suffering. The world is full of pain, yet instead of seeking God's solution and asking for forgiveness, we often dive deeper into sin, finding temporary relief but intensifying our suffering in the process—both now and eternally."

  "text": "120. The Bible Explains Death\n\nThe Bible provides answers to questions that science cannot. It tells us why we die and how we can overcome the power of death. But before we explore what Scripture says, let me ask you a question: how many unsolved murder cases do you think occurred in the United States between 1990 and 2000? Take a guess: A) 2,410, B) 31, or C) 100,000? Most people might guess 31, or some might guess 2,410. But the correct answer is C—over 100,000 people were killed in various ways, and no one was held accountable. If you were a loved one of one of these victims, you would no doubt feel outraged by such injustice. This makes the idea of final justice on the Day of Judgment seem reasonable. C. S. Lewis put it well: “There is no doctrine I would more willingly remove from Christianity than the doctrine of hell, if it were up to me. But it has the full support of Scripture and, especially, our Lord’s own words; it has always been held by the Christian Church, and it aligns with reason.”\n\nWhen we see crimes like these, the idea of hell makes sense—God cannot, will not, and should not allow wrongdoers to go free. But the Bible warns that God will be thorough in His judgment. You may not be a murderer, but consider this checklist based on the Ten Commandments:\n\n- Have you ever lied, even once?\n- Have you ever stolen anything, no matter the value?\n- Have you ever looked at someone with lust, as Jesus said was the same as committing adultery in the heart?\n\nIf you’ve answered \"yes\" to even these three, you are a liar, thief, and adulterer at heart according to God's standard. And that’s just three commandments. God sees all, and on the Day of Judgment, nothing will be hidden. Will you be innocent or guilty when you face God? Deep down, your conscience knows you will be guilty. Without forgiveness, this would mean eternal separation from God.\n\nBut the good news is that God doesn’t want anyone to be lost. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son, Jesus, to take the punishment for our sins: “God demonstrated His love for us, in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Jesus took on all of humanity’s sins, was wounded for our wrongs, and then rose from the dead, conquering death. There is no other way to be saved except through Jesus. No religion, no prophet, no amount of good deeds can save you—only Jesus.\n\nSo, cry out to God for forgiveness, repent, and trust in Jesus Christ, just as you would trust a parachute to save your life. Through the cross, God offers the gift of eternal life. Is that not an incredible offer?\n\nThink about it: you are going to die, maybe in 20 years or maybe tonight. What are you waiting for? Don’t let petty issues or your love for sin lead you to hell. Confess and turn away from your sins right now. If you’re unsure how, you can pray something like this:\n\n“Dear God, please forgive my sins (name them). I repent of all I have done wrong. I thank you for Jesus, who took my punishment and rose again. I trust in Him as my Lord and Savior. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”\n\nNow, read the Bible daily and follow what it teaches. God will never let you down."
